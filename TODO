Lots of things.  Some I've thought of:

== Haskell ==

* Talk about modularity and imports.  Import lists, export lists.  Cabal
* Types and typing.  Algebraic datatypes.
* Merge sort and algorithm analysis
* map, fold, other common pattern
* Type classes, Functor, Applicative functor
* Monad

== C ==

* Repeat the factorial.  We cannot do tail call elimination in C.  Do the transform to a while loop.
* Includes and build systems (make, redo).  Standard library.
* Memory management (heap vs stack).  Simple IO and talking to the OS (syscalls).  Memory protection.
* Arrays as pointers with pointer arithmetic.  Bounds checking (counting and terminators).  Structs/unions.
* Linked list, doubly, circular
* iterator, function pointer, macros, binary search
* Reference counting
