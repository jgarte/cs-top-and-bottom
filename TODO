Lots of things.  Some I've thought of:

== Haskell ==

* Applicative functor and Monad
* Dynamic typing (universal sum type over Hask)

== C ==

* iterator, function pointer, binary search
* Reference counting

== Ruby ==

* Memoized fibonacci
* Classes and inheritance
* Duck typing and monkeypatching
* Mix-in modules
* Metaprogramming
