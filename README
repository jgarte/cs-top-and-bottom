This material aims to teach principles and understanding fundamental to study of Computer Science and programming in general.  It is intended to be accesible to motivated beginners, but useful to those with programming experience.  It is not a tutorial or a getting started guide for a particular language, paradigm, or application, but general fundamentals.

The general philosophy of this material is that Computer Scientists need to have an understanding of both mathematical theory (the "top" or "high level") and inner machine workings (the "bottom" or "low level") and practical applications of both.
